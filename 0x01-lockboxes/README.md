## Lockboxes Challenge

## Description

This project contains a function that determines if all the locked boxes can be opened given the keys inside them. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the first box is considered unlocked.

## Functionality

- `canUnlockAll(boxes)`: Function that checks if all boxes can be opened.

## Usage

To test the functionality of the `canUnlockAll` function, run the `main_0.py` file. The various test cases demonstrate how the function behaves with different inputs.

### Example

```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))  # Output: True
